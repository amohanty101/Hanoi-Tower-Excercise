#Tower of Hanoi Exercise
This excercise was to solve what's called the Tower of Hanoi problem programmatically 

This is a famous problem where monks were asked to move all the disks from one tower to another tower, using a third tower as a staging point. But they could only ever move the top disk of any stack. And they can only move one disk at a time. And any disk that was moved must be moved to a tower, to sit on top of a larger disk. So, you can never have a larger disk sitting on top of a smaller one. So, the goal is to get from this configuration to this configuration. But to do it moving disks one at a time. 

The callenge is to create an algorithm that can accomplish this
